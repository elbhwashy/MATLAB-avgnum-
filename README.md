# MATLAB-avgnum-
Write a MATLAB function called avgnum that will repeat the process of prompting the user for positive numbers, until the user enters a negative number, as earlier. Instead of echo-printing them, however, the function will print the average (of just the positive numbers). If no positive numbers are entered, the function will print an error message instead of the average.
